Tailwind Lunch and Learn - Firebase
===================================

Hey! Here's a quick demo chat application using [Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/) and virtual-dom

#### Running it locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chinedufn/tailwind-lnl-firebase
cd tailwind-lnl-firebase
npm install
npm run start
```

Now anytime you change `index.js` your browser will live reload with your changes

#### Exercises if you'd like to poke around

- Try also displaying the time of chat messages
