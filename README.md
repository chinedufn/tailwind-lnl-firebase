Tailwind Lunch and Learn - Firebase
===================================

Hey! We're sharing the code for our Lunch and Learns over at [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindapp.com/)

---

Here's a quick demo chat application using [Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/) and [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom)

#### Running it locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chinedufn/tailwind-lnl-firebase
cd tailwind-lnl-firebase
npm install
npm run start
```

Now anytime you change `index.js` your browser will live reload with your changes

#### Exercises if you'd like to poke around

- Try also displaying the time of chat messages
- Add a component that lets you change your username
